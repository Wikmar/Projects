# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. These projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data directory is used for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/datacleaning%26analysis/EbayCarSales.ipynb): Cleaning a car sales dataset from Kleinanzeigen (German eBay website) and through exploratory analysis identify correlation between price and several features.
	- [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/visualisation/FandangoRatings.ipynb): Fandango has strong evidence that its' ratings are biased. We study the data further of Fandangos movie ratings to see where discrepencies lie, based on evidence suggesting movie ratings almost always rounding upwards.
  - [Analysing HackerNews Posts](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/datacleaning%26analysis/HackerNews.ipynb): Compares number of comments on posts that are asking questions and those that are displaying a project/product and identifies times of popularity of posting comments.
  - [Visualising Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/visualisation/VisualisingEarningsOnMajors.ipynb): Explores a cleaned dataset of outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. Answers questions such as if popular majors make more money, male/female ratio and quantity of students in respective categories.
  - [Finding The Best Markets To Advertise In](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/stats/BestMarkets.ipynb): Using freeCodeCamp's 2017 survey which contain approximately 20,000 developers, we clean and analyse the dataset to identify the best markets to advertise an e-learning company i.e. as cheaply as feasible and to reach the optimal number of prospective clients.
  
  *Tools: Numpy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Forecasting Future Demand Of Power Consumption](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/Household_Power_Consumption.ipynb): Exploratory analysis of a dataset describing electricity consumption of an individual household over a period of 4 years. Implements a recurrent neural network and an autoregressive model to forecast future demand.
	- [Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/machinelearning/PredictingHouseSales.ipynb): Delves into using linear regression and how to improve it via data cleaning and cross validation, reducing the RMSE. We predict the Sale Price of houses in Iowa.
  - [Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/machinelearning/PredictingCarPrices.ipynb): Implement a k - nearest neightbours algorithm to predict a car's market price from an automobile dataset containing several interesting features.
  - [Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/machinelearning/DigitsClassifier.ipynb): Using the built in function load_digits() (from scikit_) test different neural network models on to explore the complexity and limitations of image classification, then use multiple choices of hidden layers to understand how to optimise accuracy.
  
  *Tools: Tensorflow, scikit_, Numpy, Pandas*

- ### SQL

	- [SQL Business Analysis](https://github.com/willclist/Projects/blob/master/sql/SQLBusinessAnalysis2.ipynb): Uses SQL queries to extract relevant data and visualise them within several plots to gain information about clientelesâ€™ purchases of albums and songs.
  
  *Tools: SQLite, PySpark*
